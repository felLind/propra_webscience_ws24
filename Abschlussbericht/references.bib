              social media is too fragmented. Each year, new shared tasks and
              datasets are proposed, ranging from classics like sentiment
              analysis to irony detection or emoji prediction. Therefore, it is
              unclear what the current state of the art is, as there is no
              standardized evaluation protocol, neither a strong set of baselines
              trained on such domain-specific data. In this paper, we propose a
              new evaluation framework (TweetEval) consisting of seven
              heterogeneous Twitter-specific classification tasks. We also
              provide a strong set of baselines as starting point, and compare
              different language modeling pre-training strategies. Our initial
              experiments show the effectiveness of starting off with existing
              pre-trained generic language models, and continue training them on
              Twitter corpora.",
